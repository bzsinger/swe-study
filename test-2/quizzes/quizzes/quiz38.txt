In the video store refactoring, Fowler used Replace Type Code with State / Strategy.
With that refactoring which of the following is true?
(Maybe more than one.)
[http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceTypeCodeWithStateStrategy.html]

  switch statement would be removed entirely
  test harness would have to change
  movie type would be easy to change
  RegularPrice, NewReleasePrice, and ChildrensPrice would extend Price
  Movie would become an abstract class
  RegularMovie, NewReleaseMovie, and ChildrensMovie would extend Movie
